Geometric Control of a Quadrotor on SE(3)
=========================================


This repo contains MATLAB/Simulink code that implements a geometric controller on SE(3), based on the analysis and control presented by Lee et al. [1],[2].

As demonstrated in [2], the quadrotor is initialized upside down and is shown to stabilize itself into an upright position, as shown in the animation below.
